## Hi there üëã

My name is Nirupama and I'm a Data Scientist based in Vancouver, Canada üá®üá¶

I currently work as a data scientist for the Provincial Health Services Authority. I am very enthuasiastic about developing scalable statistical and machine learning models in public health, and would love to explore different domains such as gaming, finance, and cybersecurity.üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I completed a Master's degree in Statistics at the University of British Columbia.

## About Me

- I'm currently working on developing and learning about more Graph Neural Networks particularly GraphSAGE üìö
- I love playing tennis üéæ and working on art üé®
- You can contact me at my email: [nirupamatamvada@gmail.com](mailto:nirupamatamvada@gmail.com?)

## Selected Projects 
- [MSc_criskcasebase](https://github.com/ntmv/MSc_criskcasebase): R package developed during my MSc. thesis to fit an elastic-net multinomial model using stochastic variance reduced gradient descent (SVRGD) to predict survival with competing risks diseases (contains the fitting and custom cross-validation function written for this model)
- [kaggle_arules](https://github.com/ntmv/kaggle-arules): A shiny dashboard showing the results of the 2017 Kaggle Data Science and Machine Learning survey using association rule learning to discover common relationships between survey answers.
- [arctic_trees]([https://github.com/ntmv/arctic_trees): Using a Bayesian Treed Gaussian Process to successfully predict the velocity of ice melt with a comparison to other commonly used tree-based ensemble methods (e.g. Random Forest) 

## Current work in progress
- [dixit-prompts](https://github.com/ntmv/dixit-prompts): A fun project I am working on in my personal time to gain experience with multimodal models to generate creative prompts for the card game [Dixit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixit_(board_game)) from abstract illustrations
